  ## Description
   This is a web application that allows users to create workouts, add exercises and see their stats for each day.  The "Fitness Tracker" view shows the user information about their most recent workout including the date, duration, number of exercises and total distance covered.  The user can add exercises to an existing workout or create a new one.  The exercises themselves are categorized as "Cardio" or "Resistance" which provides them with different options for their exercises entry. The "Dashboard" view shows the user graphs for each day and a breakdown of duration, pounds and distance.
